    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Janbala is launching a series of destination pages that provides unique, expert curated travel information
      to travelers. Each page features a location (broad or specific), and highlights various themes ranging from
      food & drinks, nature, to night life. The goal was to create a modular template that can be used to serve all
      the destination contents.

      <img src="img/destination/top-section.png" data-rjs="2" />
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The hero section displays a high quality photo of the destination with an unique tagline. The search input acts both as
      page title as well as the entry point to find and jump to another destination. The sub-navigation bar has section anchors and
      provides an overview of the page.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/destination/top-experience.png" data-rjs="2" />
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Each destination will have a top experiences list that is presented in a grid format.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/destination/modal.png" data-rjs="2"/>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Clicking on an experience image/title will reveal a detail overlay with description of the experience
      and other static information. The overlay is also an carousel for the section, therefore travelers
      can cycle through without having to go back and forth.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/destination/template1.png" data-rjs="2" class="img-double" />
      <img src="img/destination/template2.png" data-rjs="2" class="img-double"/>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Given that there are a set number of themes, a couple image grid variations was created as templates
      to be used throughout the page.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/destination/ugc.png" data-rjs="2" class="img-double" />
      <img src="img/destination/hotel.png" data-rjs="2" class="img-double"/>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      There are other modules on the page that are call to actions to social or other part of the site.
      These modules are inserted to the page when applicable.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/destination/fyi.png" data-rjs="2" />
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      One of the main page sections shows destination specific travel information such as visa info, local customs, and transportation options.
      We decided to compliment the section with illustrations to summarize the content visually so it's easier to browse through blocks of content.
