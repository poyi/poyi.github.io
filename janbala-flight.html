    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      I worked with the Janbala team to redesign the flight search experience. Based on an existing feature set,
      we refined the user experience of individual components and updated the overall visual styles to match the a new branding.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/janbala-flight/search-dropdown.png" data-rjs="2" />
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is an example of the location search dropdown, which allows travelers to search by airports and cities.
      It also intelligently display nearby airport groups with the option to search all airports nearby.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/janbala-flight/calendar.png" data-rjs="2" />
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Above shows the various states of the calendar component. Calendar shows the travel dates and the start and end date
      can be set individually. There are also logics around which dates can be selected (e.g. some international travel itinerary
      cannot be less than 1 day apart)
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/janbala-flight/flight-search.png" data-rjs="2" class="img-double"/>
      <img src="img/janbala-flight/flight-inbound.png" data-rjs="2" class="img-double"/>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      There are potentially two steps to the search listing page (for rountrip), one for selecting departure flight and the other for return flight.
      The UI of the two are almost identical with the exception of the price display. The departure step shows the total roundtrip price so the
      return flight screen only shows the price difference.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/janbala-flight/flight-timeout.png" data-rjs="2"/>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Fare changes all the time, therefore, to ensure accurate results the traveler will be prompted to refresh
      after a period of idle time.
    </p>

    <div class="section center">
      <img src="img/janbala-flight/flight-search-mobile.png" data-rjs="2" class="img-double img-medium" />
      <img src="img/janbala-flight/flight-filter-mobile.png" data-rjs="2" class="img-double img-medium"/>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
      We designed each component with responsive design in mind to ensure that the site works on any devices.
