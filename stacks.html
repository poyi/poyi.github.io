    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Stacks is a digital asset management tool that focuses on the image management
      layer and provides the flexibility for anyone to pick and choose any storage options.
      Regardless of whether you prefer to store your images on S3, Dropbox, or Google Drive, you can
      use Stacks to manage and edit your photos with ease.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      When we evaluated different options to manage the company's photos, we discovered a lot of
      dated asset management applications packed with numerous features that we may never use. In addition,
      most applications forces you to use their own database or storage method so the security or performance may not
      meet your standard. We've also looked into popular storage options such as Google Drive and Dropbox
      but they lack features such as tagging to allow users to search or browse assets.<br><br>
      With Stacks, I'm looking to create a simple tool with features around organizing images, browsing/searching,
      and collaborating with other team members while offering the flexibility for one to choose his/her own storage options.

      Assuming an account is created and the user is logged in, the main interface is the Library,
      where the user can browse and search for photos based on tags or keywords. Clicking on any photo will lead to the photo details page,
      where photo management related options will be available. The user can also visit the Album page, which contains a list of albums
      that houses a series of images.

      This is an example of the image details view where image tags can be managed. Basic
      functions such as download, share, and delete are available within this view as well.

      Above are examples of the main album list and the album page itself. Users can create albums and add images to them
      as a way to organize them in a browsable format. Album can be shared with other users so more than two people can
      manage an album.
